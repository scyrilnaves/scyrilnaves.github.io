Hi :) !<br> <br>

I am a Smart Mobility Engineer.

I finished my PhD Research 2023 in Computer Science at <a href="https://univ-cotedazur.fr/">University Cote D'Azur</a> in <a href="https://leat.univ-cotedazur.fr/">Laboratoire d'Electronique, Antennes et Télécommunications </a> jointly with <a href="https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/our-company/locations/software-labs-sophia-antipolis-2/">Renault Software Factory</a>. I work with the <a href="https://leat.univ-cotedazur.fr/edge/">EDGE Team</a> focused on Edge Computing and Digital systems. <br> <br>

My dissertation is <a href="https://theses.fr/s318859"> Distributed Ledger Technology enabled New Generation Mobility </a> in a joint project between Renault & University spearheading its Digital transformation strategy.<br><br>
I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.unice.fr/verdier/">Prof. Francois Verdier</a>. I am also extremely grateful to be co-advised Industriallly by my principal advisor <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/severineglock"> Severine Glock </a> and advisor <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/patricia-guitton-275914b">Patricia Guitton</a> of  <a href="https://www.mobilize.com/en/">Mobilize</a> and Renault Software Factory.<br> <br>

Previously In 2019, I received my Masters in Computer Science from University Cote D'Azur where I was directed by <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/davidbercovitz"> David Bercovitz </a> working on Digital Transformation of the Automotive Industry by Blockchain Technology at Renault Software Factory.<br> <br>

In detail, my current research interests are:
 <ul>
<li>To study the applicability of a blockchain / DLT solution to several families of connected and autonomous vehicle use cases, namely: DaaS (Data as a Service) and MaaS (Mobility as a Service) and derive the associated requirements. 
</li>
<li>To make an updated inventory of the various Blockchains / DLTs available today, to study their specificities and differences by focusing on their consensus algorithm and the associated governance.</li>
  
<li>To study the applicability of these technologies to the different use cases listed below and to deduce the requirements and impacts to be applied to our vehicles: 1. The reporting of car usage data, for example mileage by eventually creating a Car Data Marketplace where the data could be monetized. The targeted data could come from vehicle data, V2X data and / or user data (IVI). </li>
  
<li>Our subject being at the level of a private blockchain or consortium, it will be necessary to respond to scientific obstacles such as the embeddable aspects of a DLT node on a car (energy, real time, possible partitioning of the algorithm, resynchronization of the on-board node depending on whether or not there is connectivity, etc.), interoperability, etc</li>
</ul>
