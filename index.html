Hi :) !<br>

I am a PhD Researcher in Computer Science at <a href="https://univ-cotedazur.fr/">University Cote D'Azur</a> in <a href="https://leat.univ-cotedazur.fr/">Laboratoire d'Electronique, Antennes et Télécommunications </a> jointly with <a href="https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/our-company/locations/software-labs-sophia-antipolis-2/"> Renault Software Factory </a>. At the university I work in the <a href="https://leat.univ-cotedazur.fr/edge/">EDGE Team</a> focused on Edge Computing and Digital systems. <br>

My dissertation is <a href="https://theses.fr/s318859"> Distributed Ledger Technology enabled New Generation Mobility </a> in a joint project between Renault & University spearheading its Digital transformation strategy. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.unice.fr/verdier/">Prof. Francois Verdier</a>. I am also extremely grateful to be co-advised Industriallly by my principal advisor <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/severineglock"> Severine Glock </a> and advisor <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/patricia-guitton-275914b"> Patricia Guitton </a> of  <a href="https://www.mobilize.com/en/"> Mobilize and </a> Renault Software Factory <br>

In detail, my research objectives are:
 <ul>
<li>The objectives of the thesis are to study the applicability of a blockchain / DLT solution to several families of connected and autonomous vehicle use cases, namely: DaaS (Data as a Service) and MaaS (Mobility as a Service) and derive the associated requirements. 
</li>
<li>The first objective of the thesis will therefore be to make an updated inventory of the various Blockchains / DLTs available today, to study their specificities and differences by focusing on their consensus algorithm and the associated governance. The performance and optimization possibilities should also be listed and evaluated.</li>
<li>The second objective of the thesis will be to study the applicability of these technologies to the different use cases listed below and to deduce the requirements and impacts to be applied to our vehicles: 1. The reporting of car usage data, for example mileage by eventually creating a Car Data Marketplace where the data could be monetized. The targeted data could come from vehicle data, V2X data and / or user data (IVI). A prioritization of data will have to be done first.</li>
<li>Our subject being at the level of a private blockchain or consortium, it will be necessary to respond to scientific obstacles such as the embeddable aspects of a DLT node on a car (energy, real time, possible partitioning of the algorithm, resynchronization of the on-board node depending on whether or not there is connectivity, etc.), interoperability, etc</li>
</ul>
