**Thesis Objective:** To Assess and adapt Consortium Blockchain Technologies for Connected Car solutions focussing on CONSENSUS ALGORITHMS.\

**Thesis Context:**          Distributed Ledger is a variant of Distributed Systems Technology wich acts as a bridge between friendly or competing parties to create a mutually beneficial and sustainable decentralized ecosystem for sharing data, monetary transactions, digital objects, and assets while guaranteeing transparency, security, and privacy. Mobility solutions have been embracing distributed ledger decentralized solutions as they represent a perfect solution in the current age of multimodal transport-enabled smart cities. Be it decentralized energy grids, big data-hungry artificial intelligence platforms, autonomous vehicles, or drones they create an accountable and open society.
                             This thesis presents two insights into decentralized mobility solutions around the theme of data certification and data monetisation. Our work evaluates these two solutions from a functional perspective and throughput performance accompanied by transaction finalization. It poses certain fascinating shortcomings around Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Algorithms of Clique, Istanbul BFT, Quorum BFT, and Practical BFT, which we understand and evaluate in our work.
                             
                             I further ascertain these challenges in our conceived blockchain simulator for homogeneous and unbiased experimentation of BFT consensus algorithms. It exposes the challenges of scalability, communication complexity, failure tolerance issues, and protocol resilience.
                             
                             I treat these issues in the proposed consensus algorithm, Competing Utilitarian Byzantine Agreement (CUBA), along with its implicit variant, which leverages pipelining, quorum-based communication, network optimization, and utilitarian fairness to improve the outcome of the protocol.
