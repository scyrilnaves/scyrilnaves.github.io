Abstract:
Private or consortium blockchain networks have fewer verified participants and offer better throughput and transaction efficiency than public networks. However, as more and more blockchain consensuses are designed for private or consortium networks, their performances are often estimated without a practical use case implementation. In our use case, participants do not have to trust each other but still work together to build an ecosystem where users control their data and information. This paper analyzes the performance (transaction throughput, rejections, node participants) of Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus (BFT) using two blockchains: Hyperledger Sawtooth and Ethereum
